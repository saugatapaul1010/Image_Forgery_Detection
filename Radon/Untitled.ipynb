    "Image tampering creates some artifacts, e.g., resampling, compression, shearing,\n",
    "which are better captured by resampling features. The network can be divided into three parts-\n",
    "(1) LSTM network with resampling features, and (2) convolutional encoder, and (3) decoder network.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the first part, we divide image into patches. For each patch, resampling features [17] have\n",
    "been extracted. With extracted resampling features, we use Hilbert curve (discussed in Sec. 3.1.2)\n",
    "to determine the ordering of the patches to feed into LSTM cells. We allow LSTM cells to learn the\n",
    "transition between manipulated and non-manipulated blocks in the frequency domain. Finally, feature\n",
    "maps are generated from the LSTM cell output, which will be combined with the feature maps from the\n",
    "encoder. An encoder consists of residual block, batch normalization and activation function. At each\n",
    "residual block, two convolutions are performed with shortcut connection. After each residual unit,\n",
    "max-pooling operation is performed which gives translation invariance.\n",
